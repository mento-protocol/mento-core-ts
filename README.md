# Mento Core TS

This package provides auto-generated typescript types and ethers.js factories for interacting with the Mento Protocol

## What is Mento?

The Mento protocol is a smart contract platform built on the Celo blockchain that enables the creation of stable value digital assets. Stable assets created with Mento can be classified as 'Hybrid stable assets' as they are algorithmic, transparent and backed by a over-collateralized, diversified portfolio of exogenous crypto assets([Mento Reserve](https://reserve.mento.org/)).
